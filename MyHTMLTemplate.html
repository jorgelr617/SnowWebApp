      a) The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before 
      the <html> tag.
      
      b) The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser 
      about what version of HTML the page is written in.
      
      c) In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based 
      on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers 
      render the content correctly.
      
      d) HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.
      
      e) Tip: Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser 
      knows what type of document to expect.
      
      g) There are three different <!DOCTYPE> declarations in HTML 4.01. In HTML5 there is only 
      one: <!DOCTYPE html>
      
      h) Tip: The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive. 
      (However, in practice, it is typically capitalized.)
